Terraform Code to create 3 tier architecture for Azure.

This code is build with modules in terraform and different kinds of file structures such as main.tf, variables.tf and few modules like
App 
Web
Database
Network
ResourceGroup

The main.tf file is the entry point for terraform init, plan and apply.

This architecture consists of a resource group, where all the resources are built inside it. It mainly consits of a Vnet where resources inside which can 
communicate with each other by deafult via private IP. We have designed a 3 different subnets inside the Vnet and each Subnet is governed by diffrent Rules
via the NSG. each subnet consists of Vm's here as availability sets. We have 3 different servers inside each Subnet which are Web Server, App Server and
a Database server. 

Outside the VPN is the internet and we are allowing all incoming traffic to the Webserver only which in tern communicates to App server and then to Database server.
To fullfil these terms NSG are used.

Please find attached a small Architecture Diagram for the same.
